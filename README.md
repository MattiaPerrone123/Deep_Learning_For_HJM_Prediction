# Deep-Learning-For-HJM-Prediction


The aim of the current project, that I carried out as part of my research at Arcadia University, is to estimate hip joint moments (HJM) starting from knee joint angles and ground reaction forces in healthy controls, patients affected by an hip condition called FAIS and post-operative patients.
Being all the input data time series, an LSTM model has been implemented to accomplish this task.
Although this approach has been employed also by other studies, the current investigation is the first one to analyse the behaviour of multiple groups of individuals (healthy controls, patients and post-operative patients), to deal with subjects performing single leg squat, and one of the few including statistical test (statistical parametric mapping) between real and predicted outputs.
