# Deep-Learning-For-HJM-Prediction


The aim of the current project, that I carried out as part of my research at Arcadia University, is to estimate hip joint moments (HJM) starting from knee joint angles and ground reaction forces in healthy controls, patients affected by an hip condition called FAIS and post-operative patients.
Being all the input data time series, an LSTM model has been implemented to accomplish this task.
Although this approach has been employed also by other studies, the current investigation is the first one to analyse the behaviour of multiple groups of individuals (healthy controls, patients and post-operative patients), to deal with subjects performing single leg squat, and one of the few including statistical test (statistical parametric mapping) between real and predicted outputs.

## Dependencies
A list of the packages used for this project is included in the file Requirements.txt

## Dataset
The dataset used for the study includes 53 subjects (24 healthy controls and 29 patients with FAIS, including also 16 post-operative patients). Demographics of these subjects are included in the folder [dataset](./dataset/).
Since every subject performed three single leg squat trials with each leg, this leads to a total of 414 observations.
However, several observations have been discarded because of bad sampling during data acquisition (see main.py), so the final number of samples id 334.
